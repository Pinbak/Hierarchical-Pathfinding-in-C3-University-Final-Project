# Hierarchical Pathfinding in C3 (Originally "Project")

Year 3 university dissertation project. Inspired by games such as SimTower, Theme Hotel, Corporation Inc. and Project Highrise, I created a pathfinding solution which utilizes a hierarchical approach to reduce CPU usage.
The project has an implementation of both A* and BFS, but uses A* for its speed. Second to this, a finite-state machine model was implemented for the agents "action selection". A simple building system was also added to show off procedural generation of the search graph.
All information is presented in a dissertation form see Documentation.

The project runs in Construct 3 and was written in JavaScript.

## Features

- A* and BFS both graph generation and searching have been implemented.
- Action selection through a finite machine using a time-based approach (as opposed to needs).
- Ability to build a "tower" complete with residential, eatery, and office blocks.

## Documentation

The process has been documented and can be found in the PDF called documentation.

## Languages

JavaScript was used written in VSCode.
